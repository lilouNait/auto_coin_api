# Garage Corner Rest API


## Introduction

* The Garage Corner is an application that allows you to find the nearest garages from you or to find the 
best garage for your car.
* In this application, you can be two types of users, client or partner :
The Client is the user who is searching for garages and the Partner is the user 
who is offering garages.
* The application is based on a front-end for the User Interface and a Back-End for the Datas which are exposed by a Rest 
API. 

## Technologies for the REST API

* We have chosen to use the Framework SpringBoot 2.1.4 to expose the REST API. All the datas are stored using 
an h2 base. The particularity of the h2 base is that it is all managed by the Java Framework and doesn't require other installation 

## Technical Documentation

* All the technical documentation can be found in the documentation folder which is generated on application maven install job. Three main technical documentation can be found in this folder:
1. A swagger.json which a json file that represents the global architecture of the exposed API
2. DocumentationAPI.html is a more friendly represented of the architecture of the API. 
3. The JavaDoc folder contains a basic javadoc rendered documentation that lists all the classes and functions used for the application.
